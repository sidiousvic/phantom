## [Unreleased]

### 👻 v3.0.0
- [x] Class—based
- [x] TS—friendly
- [x] Avoids innerHTML (XSS safe, no phantomExorciser)
- [x] User can define component `state` and `children` via class methods.
- [x] `render` method can define HTML as template strings, no JSX
- [x] Use custom elements such as `<app><app/>` to wrap component markup
- [x] Object reference to any component and its state and inner elements. `const {app, child} = Phantom(App)`
- [x] Provides access to a component's state, e.g. `app.photos` would return App's photos state.
- [x] **Experimental** potential to provide useful decorators for component methods, such as `@onMount`
- [x] More goodies to come.
